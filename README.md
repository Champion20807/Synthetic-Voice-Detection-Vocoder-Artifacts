# LibriSeVoc Dataset
LibriSeVoc is a new open-source dataset for the task of vocoder artifact detection. 
We derived the LibriSeVoc dataset from the widely used LibriTTS speech corpus, which is often utilized in text-to-speech research. The LibriTTS corpus is based on the Librispeech dataset, which contains samples extracted from audiobooks available on LibriVox.
