# Synthetic-Voice-Detection-Vocoder-Artifacts

# LibriSeVoc Dataset
We are the first to identify neural vocoders as a source of features to expose synthetic human voices.
We provide LibriSeVoC as a dataset of self-vocoding samples created with six state-of-the-art vocoders to highlight and exploit the vocoder artifacts.

# Deepfake Detection
We propose a new approach to detecting synthetic human voices by exposing signal artifacts left by neural vocoders and trained with self-supervised representational learning.
We have modified and improved the RawNet2 baseline by adding multi-loss, lowering the error rate from 6.10% to 4.54% on ASVspoof Dataset.
